LOST & FOUND FILM BUREAU – UI DESIGN GUIDE

Applies to every screen. No exceptions.

---

VISUAL STYLE

* Background: solid black #000000 — used on every screen
* Font: one single custom font (to be provided); no system fallbacks or font mixing
* Text color: pure white #FFFFFF
* Button hover color: soft gray #AAAAAA
* No gradients, shadows, strokes, or decorative visuals
* No frames or outlines on any UI elements, including buttons and fields
* Overall look: minimal, quiet, and polished, in the spirit of Apple

---

LAYOUT & SPACING

* Primary content (headlines, forms, search, results, buttons) is center-aligned on most screens
* Use left-alignment only when it improves usability (e.g., form labels, result lists)
* Avoid sidebars or multi-column layouts — keep everything balanced and open
* Vertical spacing should follow a strict modular rhythm (e.g., 24px, 32px)
* Every element should have enough breathing room
* The design must be legible and elegant when presented on a 16:9 screen
* Use consistent spacing units throughout (e.g., 8px/16px/32px)

---

UI COMPONENTS

Buttons:

* Text-based with rounded corners, no frames or outlines
* Default: white text on black background
* Hover: soft transition to light gray text or fill
* Cursor: pointer on hover
* On click: subtle Apple-style scale-down feedback (see Interactions)
* No shadows, borders, or background strokes
* Large enough for easy interaction and visibility

Form Fields & Dropdowns:

* Rounded corners only, no outlines or underlines
* Text: white or light gray on black
* Layout: centered where possible, labels can be left-aligned
* On focus: optional subtle glow or brightness change (no lines or borders)

Movie Cards:

* Poster format: 7x10, centered
* Rounded image corners
* No visible card borders
* Clear spacing between poster, title, and logline
* Visual hierarchy controlled by spacing and type only

---

INTERACTIONS

* All hover and focus effects should be soft and quick (\~200ms transitions)
* Loading states: subtle animated ellipsis or pulsing dot
* Keyboard navigation: fully supported (Tab to move, Enter to submit)
* Cursor states: pointer on interactive items, text on inputs
* Tap/click feedback (Apple-style):

  * Buttons scale down slightly on press (`transform: scale(0.97)`)
  * Creates a physical, responsive feel
  * Easy to implement with a few lines of CSS

---

COPY & MICROCOPY

* Tone: clear, concise, friendly
* Error messages: casual but helpful (“Oops, something went wrong. Try again.”)
* No robotic, overly technical, or generic language
* No emojis, no icons in text

---

ACCESSIBILITY & CONTRAST

* All elements must pass WCAG contrast standards
* All text and interface items must be clearly readable at a distance
* Full keyboard and screen-reader accessibility required

---

CONSISTENCY & RESTRAINT

* One font only — no type variation outside defined use
* No alternate visual styles or decorative “moments”
* No icons, shadows, or noise
* All components (buttons, fields, cards) are built from the same base principles
* Rounded shapes only — no sharp corners or visual frames
* Everything must feel intentional, clean, and part of a single, unified product
